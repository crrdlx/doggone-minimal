# Doggone Minimal Website

The Doggone Minimal Website is a single web page template that was inspired by other, foul-mouthed websites. Those are fantastic, but they are foul-mouthed. 

The template for this web page was from the "Perfect 'Foul-Mouthed' Website.com" who kindly gave permission for others to do with it whatever they pleased. So, I took out the foul-mouthed parts.

The "minimal_website.html" file is not the one to use. It's just a building-block template. 

The "index.html" file is the one to use. Below is a screenshot of the index.html file. But)., the screenshot looks a bit cruddy on a mobile device. The doggone minimal website page can be [viewed online with this link](https://crrdlx.github.io/pages/dmw.html), where's it's much cleaner. Check it.
