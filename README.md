# Doggone Minimal Website

The Doggone Minimal Website is a single web page template that was inspired by other, foul-mouthed websites. Those are fantastic, but they are foul-mouthed. 

The template for this web page was from the "Perfect 'Foul-Mouthed' Website.com" who kindly gave permission for others to do with it whatever they pleased. So, I took out the foul-mouthed parts.

Below is a screenshot. But)., the screenshot looks a bit cruddy on a mobile device. The doggone minimal website page can be [viewed online this link](http://br549.mywebcommunity.org/doggone.htm).
