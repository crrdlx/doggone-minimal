# Doggone Minimal Website

The Doggone Minimal Website is a single web page template that was inspired by other, foul-mouthed websites. Those are fantastic, but they are foul-mouthed. 

The template for this web page was from the "Perfect 'Foul-Mouthed' Website.com" who kindly gave permission for others to do with it whatever they pleased. So, I took out the foul-mouthed parts.

Here's a screenshot:
