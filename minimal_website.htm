<header><h1>This is from the <span style="color:green">best bleeping</span> website.</h1>
<aside>And it's more perfect than the last guy's.</aside>
</header>
<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal effort to improve this.</h2>
<p><strong>7 declarations.</strong></p>
<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a
href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">old site</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. Here's <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">a second one</a> (the source of this site), and <a href="https://evenbettermotherfucking.website/">another one</a>, and <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/">yet another</a>. This one is the second one and is so simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original <strong>perfect</strong> website:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your screens</li>
<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your browsers</li>
<li>The thing's <em>still</em> accessible to everyone that visits your site</li>
<li>It's <em>still</em> legible and gets your point across</li>
</ul>
<h3> This is an image I put in:</h3>
<p>
<img class="centered" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Xiphias_gladius2.jpg" width=200px>

<h3>And this is a button I put in:</h3>
<center><div class="w3-container">
  <a href="http://br549.mywebcommunity.org/fish/" class="w3-button w3-round-large w3-green">Press to Continue</a>
</div></center>
<h3>And guess what:</h3>
<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how. <span style="color:darkgreen">One idea is to change the font color, without using the old font tag.</span></p>

<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some sorry website you're building. The defaults are trash&mdash;pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...oh well.</p>
<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, bad. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a bad book.</p>

<h2>A little less contrast</h2>
<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 lines.</p>

<h2>Size Matters</h2><p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</p>

<h2>Line-width, friend</h2>
<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
<h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> satire</h3>
<p>I love what the creator of <a
href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not totally bad.</p>
